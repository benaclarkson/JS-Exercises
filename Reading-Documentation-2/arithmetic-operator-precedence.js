/**
 * Task: Find the MDN documentation on operator precedence, and use it to find out which result the expression 4 * 5 + 3 ** 2 / 10 evaluates to.

 * Solution: Given the operators in the code above, exponentiation is evaluated first, then multiplication and division, then addition, resulting in a final value of `20.9`.
