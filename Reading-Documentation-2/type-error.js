/**
 * Task: Run the following code.
 
 * let tweet = 'Woohoo! :-)';
 * 
 * if (tweet.length() > 140) {
 *   console.log('Tweet is too long!');
 * }
 
 * You'll see that it raises an error:
 * TypeError: tweet.length is not a function

 * Check the documentation of both TypeError and length, in order to find out what causes the error.
 
 * Solution: The error comes from using `length` in the incorrect way. It is typed as `length()` when it should be `length` without the parentheses.
